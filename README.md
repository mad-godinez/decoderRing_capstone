### :wave: Hello, and welcome! I'm so glad you're here. :smile:

## About Me :
- These days, I go by "Mad", which is pronounced like the 'mod' in "modulo", and is _not_ an indication that I'm angry :-)
- This is the first "Capstone Project" I've completed during my Software Engineering course at Thinkful.
- I am a recent college graduate from Texas State University, where I studied the Spanish Language & Computer Science.
- Even though my academic background is mainly in C++, I'm having a ton of fun learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! 

## About the "Decoder Ring" Assignment : 
This repo contains the solutions & unit tests I have written for a series of encoding/decoding puzzles. The following links contain my source code for each segment
of this project.
  1. **Caesar Shift** : a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.

  2. **Polybius Square** : a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate.

      - [unit tests](https://github.com/mad-godinez/decoderRing_capstone/blob/3eef059188eeece653b80cb25d67732f1d574dd0/test/polybius.test.js#L1)
  3. **The Substitution Cipher** : requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the substitution alphabet.

### Project Objectives :
> This project's main objective was to gain familiarity with programming logic while devising tests to run code against. The complete utility of these puzzles can be accessed on the project's [Home Page](https://mad-godinez.github.io/decoderRing_capstone/).

### Languages & Tools Used :
   - My contributions: 
        * JavaScript
            * Testing Framework : Mocha
            * Assertion Library : Chai
        * Visual Studio Code
        * MacOSX, `npm` and `git` command-line programming in the terminal
   - The rest of the project: 
        * HTML 
        * CSS
        * JavaScript
### Installing & Running this Project :
If you want to run this project on your machine instead of just playing with the puzzles on the Home Page, here you go!
1. clone this repository, or download the .zip file
2. open a shell terminal window in the location of the project's root directory
3. in your machine's terminal window, type `npm i` and press `enter`
4. ..., type `npm test` and press `enter` to see the results of my code against the tests

#### * Important Note: 
   I was responsible for writing my solutions **solely** to the above documents in the `/src/` and `/tests/` directories.
   The rest of the documents in the repository were given to me as a package for data handling & testing purposes and are therefore not my intellectual property.

#### _Thanks for looking! - Mad._
